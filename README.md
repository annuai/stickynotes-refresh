# stickynotes-refresh

A Refresh for the UI and Design of indicator-stickynotes, a linux Sticky Notes app.

Stickynotes is a really cool idea on the desktop.But still, on Linux - it looked almost weird and aged.indicator-stickynotes is a real powerful app, but it lacks the looks to make it click.I wondered why not create an edit for the app and publish it, I just made some edits to the UI file and Icons and now I hope, it looks better than ever.

**NB:**You need indicator-stickynotes app by Umang Kumar installed from his PPA for this patch to work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful, the Bash Script resets your data, be sure you have backups of your notes.
